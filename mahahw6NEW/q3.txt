3. Which of the following statements will potentially execute? And give values for A, B and C that will make the statement execute:
    5.1. if (A is true AND B is true) OR (A is false AND B is true) THEN color="blue"
    5.2. if (A is true AND B is false) OR (A is NOT true AND A is false) THEN color="green"
    5.3. if (A is true AND B is false OR A is false) OR (A is either true or false) THEN color="yellow"
    5.4. if (false AND true) OR (false OR true) THEN color="white"
    
     ANS: 5.1. if (A is true AND B is true) OR (A is false AND B is true) THEN color="blue"
 A B
 T T = BLUE
 F T =BLUE
 T F =NOT EXECUTE
 F F= NOT EXECUTE
 
  ANS: 5.2. if (A is true AND B is false) OR (A is NOT true AND A is false) THEN color="green"
 A B
 T T = NOT EXECUTE
 F T ="green"
 T F ="green"
 F F= "green"
  5.3. if (A is true AND B is false OR A is false) OR (A is either true or false) THEN color="yellow"
 ANS:
