6. Read the following program:

 variable x = 0
 variable y = 10
 variable i = 0
 variable holder = 0
 
 WHILE i does not have the same value as y EXECUTE THESE LINES
    if (i divides 2 without a remainder) THEN holder = existing value of holder + i 
    increment i by 1
    GO TO WHILE ABOVE
 END OF WHILE
 
 Answer the following:
    5.1. What is the final value of "holder" when the program is done running? 
    sol: the final value of "holder" when the program is done running=21
    
    5.2. What is the final value of "i" when the program is done running?
    ANS:the final value of "i" when the program is done running=10
    the final value of "i"print  when the program is done running=9
    becuse is 10 numbre from 0 to 9
